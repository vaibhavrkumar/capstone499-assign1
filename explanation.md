I have created two unit tests for the program namely QuickSortTest and SwapTest.

For QuickSortTest, I am testing my program using assertArrayEquals. The expected input is sorted array and unsorted array. The test runs successfully with no errors if there is no flaw in the code.

For  SwapTest, I am also testing using assertArrayEquals. 
To test this program, I have created another array with the first and last elements swapped. This is what the algorithm should produce if everything goes right. So, the expected input is the swapped array outputted by the program and the correct output created by me.
